# EatSafe

Eatsafe is an application developed for android devices. It utilizes a combination of API's from Vancouver, B.C to display information about a restaurants health inspection. The purpose is to provide the customers information that are not typically known in order to allow them to make a more informed decision of eating at that restaurant.

Currently, users are able to find restaurants health inspection data through searching restaurants by name, and through google maps, which contains markers to display available restaurants to view.

This application was created using Android Studio and Java.
