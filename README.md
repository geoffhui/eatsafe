# EatSafe

Eatsafe is an application developed for android devices. It utilizes a combination of API's from Vancouver, B.C to display information about a restaurants health inspection. The purpose is to provide the customers information that are not typically known in order to allow them to make a more informed choice of weather they would like to eat at that restaurant.

Currently, users are able to find restaurants health inspection data through searching restaurants by name, and through google maps, which contains markers to display available restaurants to view.

This application was created using Android Studio and Java.

To run this application, clone the eatsafe folder from https://github.com/geoffhui/eatsafe. Run MainActivity.java found in "./app/src/main/java/com/example/eatsafe" in Android Studio with a device using API 26.
