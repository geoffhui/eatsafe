Eatsafe is an application developed for android devices. It utilizes a combination of API's from Vancouver, B.C to display information about a restaurants health inspection. The purpose is to provide the customers information that are not typically known in order to allow them to make a more informed choice of weather they would like to eat at that restaurant.

# Currently, users are able to find restaurants health inspection data through searching restaurants by name, and through google maps, which contains markers to display available restaurants to view.
